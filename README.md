# BikeSharing

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to see what the market looks like for bike rentals in New York to see if it was worth starting a company in Des Moine, Iowa. This was done by obtaining the bikeshare data, converting the trip duration from an integer to a date time format using pandas. 

## Results
##### I started off by looking at the breakdown of times that users would begin using their bikes. we can see that between the times of 2pm and 7pm is when most bike rentals occur. The reason for this is probably because most people are getting off of work at this time. We can also see that this is when we should have bikes available at the populat starting locations.

##### In this analysis we can see where bikes should be positioned and ready for users to pick up during the busy hours.

##### When the day is over we can have picked up at the ending location to pick up and returned back to the popular starting location

##### Here we see the duration of the rental and that a lot of the rentals are 6 minutes long. This would require a lot of workers to shuttle bike back to popular starting locations. Very few rentals go over 1 hour.

##### Here we can see that it is mostly males that are renters who have similar durations to females and users who do not identify.

##### we can see that monday through friday the morning rentals are busy as well the afternoons. During the weekends the start times are later and end early and usage is not as impacted but spread out from 9am to 7pm.

##### This slide further breaksdown the previous slide and shows what type of users each gender is and shows that of the users, they are more likely to be subscribers.

## Summary
From this analysis we can see that there are a lot of users who are males who are more likely to be subscribers than customers who just rent. It is still hard to tell if this would be a good business in Des Moine because temperature and how densely populated the area is. Some slides I would consider is showing the average temperature for that area throughout the day as well as if it rained or not. Another slide I would present is the population density of an area. If people are spread out they are more likely to drive a car.
